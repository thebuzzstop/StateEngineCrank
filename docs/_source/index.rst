Welcome to State Engine Crank
=============================
This is the documentation for State Engine Crank (SEC), a tool that converts a `PlantUML <http://www.plantuml.com>`_
state diagram into executable code.

State Engine Crank was so named because, given PlantUML as input, it *"cranks out a state engine executable."*

:todo: Provide an overview of the various topics covered.
